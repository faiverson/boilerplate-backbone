# [Start Boilerplate]

## Quick start
You don't need nothing to install this boilerplate. It is a package using Jquery, Backbone and Require.js

Also others libraries and plugins like: 
* Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* Jade engine template (http://jade-lang.com/)
* Lodash (http://lodash.com/)
* Amplify (for LocalStorage: https://github.com/dev360/Backbone.amplify)
* Highcharts (not used, but added to require. More info: (http://www.highcharts.com/)
* Datatable (Sort tables: http://www.datatables.net/)
Prepare for multilanguage support and it's using the event aggregator pattern for views comunication (see mediator)
